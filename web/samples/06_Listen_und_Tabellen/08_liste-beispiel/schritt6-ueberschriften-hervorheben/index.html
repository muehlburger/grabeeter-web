	<strong>"Rules Of Smart And Successful Web-development"</strong> is <a href="http://www.alvit.de/vf/">Vitaly Friedman's</a> personal pick of the main ideas and concepts, which might improve the quality and popularity of your web-sites and provide a good foundation for successful development in the future.
</p>
<div id="liste">
	<ul id="root_list">
		<li>Respect your visitors.<br />
		 Don't try to force your visitors to read the content of your web-pages. Let them choose and decide what they want to read. For if you have someting to tell, you'll find your listeners. Frankly, you are as good as everybody else. What would be your reaction to a dozen of pop-ups and overflown ad blocks? My point exactly. </li>
		<li>Bad advertisement is evil.<br />
		 Disturbing ad blocks might improve your ad revenue for a while, but in a long run they won't make your web-site successful. In fact, you won't <a href="projects.html">gain respect</a> and <a href="expl.html">explore the potential</a> you and your projects might have.
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid wrong SEO and bad PR.<br />
			 Incorrect search engine optimization &#040;exchanging links with every possible site in the net, placing your link in link farms etc.&#041; will lead your site to banning from major search engines. The algorithms search engines use are being improved all the time, so in the end you risk to find yourself with <abbr title="Google Pagerank">Pagerank</abbr> 0 below all possible results you wanted to compete with. </li>
			<li>Contact, but don't spam.<br />
			 Let those who might be interested in your content, be aware of your content. First define your aim and potential clientele. Then take a close look at those who might be interested in your service. Think about the sites they are likely to visit. Only then contact the authors of these sites, describing the advantages of your services. </li>
			<li>Don't overestimate, don't underestimate.<br />
			Be descriptive; don't send a link, send an invitation with a proper description of what makes your web-site different from similar projects. Make sure the person you are writing to realizes that it can be useful for the visitors of his/her site. <strong>Don't spam, don't advertise, offer useful content</strong>. </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Hate Internet Explorer if you like, but don't ignore its users.<br />
		 Don't design your code for special browsers or special resolutions. However, apply your code to Internet Explorer just as you apply it to other browsers. And although I, personally, try to avoid browser hacks, sometimes you can't avoid them &#8212; nevertheless, browser hacks should be the last option. Internet Explorer might not be <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">the best browser out there</a>, but it is still used by more than <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprisd=0">85% of web users</a>. See #1.</li>
		<li>Develop your own style. Develop your own ideas.<br />
		 Let yourself be inspired, but don't copy. It is far more interesting to find out what you are capable of than what other people are capable of. Explore your imagination and curiosity. New or improved old ideas are more likely to attract web users than the copied old ones.</li>
		<li>Respect the standards. Think about people.<br />
		 Taking web standards into consideration will help you to save a lot of work in the future. It won't take long until web standards will become a standard in the Web; and since you are creating web-pages for people, it seems to be reasonable to spend some extra hours checking the code and applying it to the standards &#8212; in case the code doesn't conform to the standards. <strong>Readability, accessibility, usability.</strong> Respecting them, you respect your visitors.</li>
		<li>Be clear. Use a clear markup.<br />
		 Don't be afraid to say what you mean. Ambiguity creates an unneeded distance between you and your visitors. Saying precisely, what you want to discuss or present, you start an active dialogue with your readers. </li>
		<li>Care about your content.<br />
		 Developing web-sites, try to make them informative, interesting and well-presented. Don't forget that your visitors remember everything. Once you've offered them a link to some inappropriate web-page without proper description of what is hidden behind the link, you'll never see them again. <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Code is poetry</a>, your content is prose.</li>
		<li>
		Don't be concerned about web-crawlers and SEO optimization.<br />
		 Don't think in keywords &#8212; far more important is what your web-site has to offer. Tweaking your search engine position will take much more time than writing a useful article in your weblog. </li>
